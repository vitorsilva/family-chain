## 📖 Resources Needed

### Installation Philosophy: Just-In-Time Setup
**Don't install everything upfront!** Each week tells you exactly what to install when you need it. This approach:
- Reduces initial overwhelm
- Helps you understand WHY you need each tool
- Saves disk space
- Makes troubleshooting easier

### Software Installation Timeline

**Week 1:**
- Git
- VS Code (with Solidity, Hardhat Solidity, Prettier, ESLint extensions)
- Node.js v22.14.0+
- npm 11.6.2+
- Hardhat 3.0.8+ (via `npx hardhat --init`)

**Week 2:**
- Geth (Ethereum client)

**Week 3:**
- (Hardhat already installed in Week 1)

**Week 4:**
- PostgreSQL, Redis

**Week 6:**
- Create React App or Next.js

**Week 11:**
- Go

**Week 15:**
- PSD2 sandbox credentials (start registration early - can take time!)

**Week 17:**
- Python

**Week 27:**
- Gambit (mutation testing for Solidity) - requires Rust/Cargo

**Week 29:**
- Docker

### Tool Versions & Documentation (Updated Week 1)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Version Matters!**
This course uses specific versions with breaking changes from older tutorials. Always check documentation for YOUR version!

**Current Project Versions:**
| Tool | Version | Documentation | Notes |
|------|---------|--------------|-------|
| Node.js | v22.14.0+ | https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/ | LTS version |
| npm | 11.6.2+ | https://docs.npmjs.com/ | Included with Node.js |
| Hardhat | 3.0.8+ | https://hardhat.org/docs/getting-started | ⚠️ v3 has breaking changes from v2! |
| ethers.js | 6.15.0 | https://docs.ethers.org/v6/ | ⚠️ v6 API different from v5 |
| Solidity | ^0.8.28 | https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.28/ | Latest stable |
| TypeScript | ~5.8.0 | https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/ | Required for Hardhat 3 tests |
| Mocha | 11.7.4 | https://mochajs.org/ | Test framework |
| Chai | 5.3.3 | https://www.chaijs.com/ | Assertion library |

**Critical Hardhat 3 Breaking Changes:**
- ⚠️ **Build command:** `npx hardhat build` (NOT `compile`)
- ⚠️ **Config secrets:** Use `npx hardhat keystore` (NOT `.env` files)
- ⚠️ **Test files:** Must be TypeScript `.ts` (NOT `.js`)
- ⚠️ **Config variables:** Use `configVariable()` (NOT `dotenv`)

**Why These Versions Matter:**
- Most online tutorials use Hardhat 2.x - commands won't work!
- ethers.js v5 and v6 have different APIs - code examples may break
- Hardhat 3 requires TypeScript for tests - JavaScript won't run
