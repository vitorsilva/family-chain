## Guidelines for Creating Checklists

### 1. Select Key Questions

From each learning guide's self-assessment section:
- Choose 2-4 most important questions
- Focus on core concepts that apply to future weeks
- Include questions that test understanding, not just memorization

### 2. List Concrete Deliverables

Be specific about what should be completed:
- ‚úÖ Code deployed and working
- ‚úÖ Tests passing with specific metrics
- ‚úÖ Files created in specific locations
- ‚úÖ Tools installed and configured

### 3. Reference Reading Material

List the specific chapters assigned for that week:
- Bitcoin Book chapters (for fundamentals)
- Ethereum Book chapters (for implementation)

### 4. Make It Actionable

Use checkboxes `- [ ]` so the user can:
- Track progress
- Mark completion
- See what's remaining

### 5. Include Motivational Framing

End with positive reinforcement:
- "If you can answer all questions confidently, you're ready for Week X!"
- "This is the week to clarify concepts before [next major topic]!"
