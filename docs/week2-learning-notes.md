# Week 2 Learning Notes
## Running Your First Ethereum Node

**Week Duration:** 2025-10-29 (in progress)
**Status:** üîÑ Class 2.1 Complete | Class 2.2 & 2.3 Pending

---

## Session: 2025-10-29

### Week 2, Class 2.1: Installing and Configuring Geth - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Context:** Starting Week 2 after completing Week 1 (environment setup, blockchain theory, first smart contract deployed to Sepolia)

---

#### Installation Environment Decision

**Question: WSL Ubuntu vs Native Windows?**
- **User has:** WSL with Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (alongside Docker Desktop)
- **Discovery:** User was initially in Docker Desktop's WSL environment (not Ubuntu)
- **Resolution:** Learned to launch specific Ubuntu distribution: `wsl -d Ubuntu`
- **Decision:** Use WSL Ubuntu (recommended path for easier Ethereum node setup)

**System Specs Verified:**
- ‚úÖ Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS
- ‚úÖ 278GB free disk space (more than enough for Sepolia ~50GB)
- ‚úÖ Kernel: 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2
- ‚úÖ Low memory usage (3%)

---

#### Geth Installation (Execution Client)

**Installation Method:** Ubuntu PPA (Personal Package Archive)

**Commands executed:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y geth
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ **Geth v1.16.5-stable** installed successfully
- ‚úÖ Go Version: go1.25.1
- ‚úÖ Architecture: amd64
- ‚úÖ Git Commit: 737ffd1bf0cbee378d0111a5b17ae4724fb2216c

**Verification:**
```bash
geth version
```

---

#### Lighthouse Installation (Consensus Client)

**Installation Method:** Manual download from GitHub releases

**Commands executed:**
```bash
cd ~
wget https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases/download/v6.0.1/lighthouse-v6.0.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
tar -xzf lighthouse-v6.0.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
sudo mv lighthouse /usr/local/bin/
rm lighthouse-v6.0.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ **Lighthouse v6.0.1-0d90135** installed successfully
- ‚úÖ BLS hardware acceleration: **true**
- ‚úÖ SHA256 hardware acceleration: **true**
- ‚úÖ Profile: maxperf
- ‚úÖ Allocator: jemalloc

**Verification:**
```bash
lighthouse --version
```

---

#### Directory Structure Created

**Commands executed:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/ethereum/sepolia/geth
mkdir -p ~/ethereum/sepolia/lighthouse
mkdir -p ~/ethereum/sepolia/jwt
```

**Structure:**
```
~/ethereum/sepolia/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ geth/         (Geth execution data)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lighthouse/   (Lighthouse consensus data)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ jwt/          (JWT secret for authentication)
```

**Verification:**
```bash
ls -la ~/ethereum/sepolia/
```

---

#### JWT Secret Generation

**What is JWT?**
- **JWT = JSON Web Token**
- Shared secret (like a password) enabling authenticated communication between Geth and Lighthouse
- Both clients must use the **exact same JWT secret file** to verify each other

**User Question:** "How will Geth and Lighthouse read the file if only owner can read/write?"
- **Answer:** Geth and Lighthouse run as the user (vitor), so they inherit user's file permissions
- `chmod 600` prevents OTHER users/processes from accessing it, but allows user's processes

**Commands executed:**
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 > ~/ethereum/sepolia/jwt/jwtsecret
cat ~/ethereum/sepolia/jwt/jwtsecret  # Verify 64-character hex string
chmod 600 ~/ethereum/sepolia/jwt/jwtsecret  # Secure permissions
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ JWT secret generated (64-character hex string)
- ‚úÖ Permissions set to 600 (owner read/write only)

---

#### Geth Verification Test

**Command executed:**
```bash
geth --sepolia --datadir ~/ethereum/sepolia/geth --authrpc.jwtsecret ~/ethereum/sepolia/jwt/jwtsecret --http --http.api eth,net,web3 --syncmode snap
```

**Expected Behavior:** ‚úÖ CONFIRMED
- ‚úÖ "Loaded JWT secret file" - JWT found and loaded
- ‚úÖ "HTTP server started endpoint=127.0.0.1:8545" - RPC endpoint ready
- ‚úÖ "Started P2P networking" - Connecting to Ethereum peers
- ‚úÖ "Chain ID: 11155111 (sepolia)" - Correct network
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Beacon client online, but no consensus updates received" - Expected! (Lighthouse not running)

**User stopped Geth with Ctrl+C** ‚úÖ

---

#### Lighthouse Verification Test

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUE: Checkpoint Sync URL Problems**

**Attempt 1: ethstaker.cc (from class guide)**
```bash
lighthouse bn --network sepolia --datadir ~/ethereum/sepolia/lighthouse --execution-endpoint http://localhost:8551 --execution-jwt ~/ethereum/sepolia/jwt/jwtsecret --checkpoint-sync-url https://sepolia.beaconstate.ethstaker.cc
```

**Result:** ‚ùå FAILED
- Error: `dns error: failed to lookup address information: Name or service not known`
- **User's diagnosis:** "URL doesn't exist anymore" (correct!)
- Verified with `curl https://sepolia.beaconstate.ethstaker.cc/` ‚Üí "Could not resolve host"

**Attempt 2: ethPandaOps (Ethereum Foundation)**
```bash
lighthouse bn --network sepolia --datadir ~/ethereum/sepolia/lighthouse --execution-endpoint http://localhost:8551 --execution-jwt ~/ethereum/sepolia/jwt/jwtsecret --checkpoint-sync-url https://checkpoint-sync.sepolia.ethpandaops.io
```

**Result:** ‚ùå FAILED
- Error: `InvalidSsz(OffsetSkipsVariableBytes(2737225))`
- Checkpoint data format incompatible with Lighthouse v6.0.1

**Attempt 3: Genesis sync (without checkpoint)**
```bash
lighthouse bn --network sepolia --datadir ~/ethereum/sepolia/lighthouse --execution-endpoint http://localhost:8551 --execution-jwt ~/ethereum/sepolia/jwt/jwtsecret
```

**Result:** ‚ùå BLOCKED
- Lighthouse refused: "Syncing from genesis is insecure and incompatible with data availability checks"
- Requires either `--checkpoint-sync-url` OR `--allow-insecure-genesis-sync`

**Attempt 4: Allow insecure genesis sync (for verification test only)**
```bash
lighthouse bn --network sepolia --datadir ~/ethereum/sepolia/lighthouse --execution-endpoint http://localhost:8551 --execution-jwt ~/ethereum/sepolia/jwt/jwtsecret --allow-insecure-genesis-sync
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS (for verification purposes)
- ‚úÖ "Lighthouse started version: Lighthouse/v6.0.1-0d90135"
- ‚úÖ "Block production enabled" with JWT path correctly loaded
- ‚úÖ "Beacon chain initialized head_slot: 0"
- ‚úÖ "Libp2p Starting" - P2P networking started
- ‚úÖ "Listening established" on ports 9000 (TCP) and 9001 (QUIC)
- ‚ùå "Error connecting to eth1 node endpoint" - **EXPECTED!** (Geth not running)
- ‚ùå "Connection refused (os error 111)" - **PERFECT!** This is what we wanted to see

**User stopped Lighthouse with Ctrl+C** ‚úÖ

---

#### Key Technical Concepts Learned

**1. Execution vs Consensus Clients**

**User's insight:** "For resilience?" (correct intuition!)

**Why Ethereum split into two clients:**
1. **Separation of concerns** - Execution logic (smart contracts) separate from consensus logic (proof-of-stake)
2. **Client diversity (resilience!)** - Different teams build different clients; if one has a bug, network doesn't fail
3. **Modularity** - Easier to upgrade one layer without breaking the other

**2. Beacon Chain**

**User question:** "What is a beacon in this context?"

**Answer:**
- **Beacon Chain = Ethereum's proof-of-stake consensus layer**
- Acts as a coordinator/beacon for validators
- "Beacons" (signals) which blocks are valid
- Validators follow the beacon to reach consensus

**Analogy:**
- **Geth (Execution)** = The worker who processes transactions
- **Lighthouse (Beacon)** = The manager who decides which work is valid

**3. Checkpoint Sync**

**User question:** "Why are we referencing an external server for our sync url?"

**Explanation:**
- **Without checkpoint sync:** Sync entire Beacon Chain from genesis (days/week)
- **With checkpoint sync:** Download recent checkpoint, sync forward from there (hours)

**Tradeoff:**
- ‚úÖ Speed (hours vs days)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Trust checkpoint provider initially
- ‚úÖ After initial sync, node validates all future blocks itself (becomes trustless going forward)

**User's decision:** "I'm comfortable with checkpoint" (pragmatic choice for learning/testnet)

---

#### Issues Encountered & Solutions

**Issue 1: Docker Desktop vs Ubuntu WSL**
- **Problem:** User was in Docker Desktop's internal environment initially
- **Symptom:** `/etc/os-release` showed "Docker Desktop", paths like `/mnt/host/c/...`
- **Solution:** Use `wsl -d Ubuntu` to launch Ubuntu distribution specifically

**Issue 2: Checkpoint Sync URL Doesn't Exist**
- **Problem:** `sepolia.beaconstate.ethstaker.cc` no longer resolves (URL outdated in class guide)
- **User's diagnosis:** Correctly identified as non-existent URL (not connectivity issue)
- **Attempted workaround:** Tried `checkpoint-sync.sepolia.ethpandaops.io` (also failed with SSZ format error)
- **Temporary solution:** Used `--allow-insecure-genesis-sync` for verification test only
- **‚ö†Ô∏è MUST RESOLVE IN CLASS 2.2:** Find working checkpoint sync URL or alternative approach

**Issue 3: Lighthouse Checkpoint SSZ Format Error**
- **Problem:** `InvalidSsz(OffsetSkipsVariableBytes(2737225))` with ethPandaOps checkpoint
- **Possible causes:**
  - Checkpoint data format incompatible with Lighthouse v6.0.1
  - Checkpoint might be for different network or corrupted
  - Lighthouse version might be too old/new for available checkpoints
- **‚ö†Ô∏è TODO FOR CLASS 2.2:**
  - Research working Sepolia checkpoint sync URLs for Lighthouse v6.0.1
  - Consider updating Lighthouse to latest version if needed
  - Check Lighthouse documentation for recommended checkpoint providers

---

#### User Learning & Engagement Highlights

**Strong Conceptual Understanding:**
- ‚úÖ Connected "resilience" to client diversity (blockchain fundamentals)
- ‚úÖ Understood trustless concept (Week 1 callback)
- ‚úÖ Asked about file permissions security (chmod 600 JWT secret)
- ‚úÖ Questioned checkpoint sync tradeoffs (trust vs speed)

**Excellent Debugging Skills:**
- ‚úÖ Diagnosed checkpoint URL as non-existent (not connectivity issue)
- ‚úÖ Verified with `curl` command before trying alternative
- ‚úÖ Good instinct to test basic connectivity (`ping 8.8.8.8`)

**Active Learning:**
- ‚úÖ Asked clarifying questions (JWT, Beacon Chain, checkpoint sync)
- ‚úÖ Understood tradeoffs and made pragmatic decisions
- ‚úÖ Comfortable with temporary workarounds for testing

---

- [x] ‚úÖ **Understanding** of execution vs consensus clients, Beacon Chain, JWT authentication

---

#### Next Steps for Class 2.2

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Resolve Checkpoint Sync Issue**

**Options to explore:**
1. **Find working Sepolia checkpoint URL for Lighthouse v6.0.1:**
   - Check https://eth-clients.github.io/checkpoint-sync-endpoints/
   - Try other public endpoints (Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode)
   - Consult Lighthouse Discord/GitHub for recommendations

2. **Update Lighthouse to latest version:**
   - Check if v6.0.1 is outdated
   - Latest version might have better checkpoint compatibility

3. **Alternative sync strategies:**
   - Use `--allow-insecure-genesis-sync` temporarily (accept slower sync)
   - Run on mainnet instead (more checkpoint providers available)
   - Use a different consensus client temporarily (Prysm, Teku)

**Class 2.2 Activities:**
- Run Geth and Lighthouse together simultaneously
- Monitor sync progress in real-time
- Understand blockchain data directories
- Query local node via RPC
- Set up basic node maintenance

**Before starting Class 2.2:**
- ‚úÖ All Class 2.1 deliverables complete
- ‚úÖ JWT secret path known: `~/ethereum/sepolia/jwt/jwtsecret`
- ‚úÖ 278GB free disk space confirmed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Checkpoint sync URL issue documented (needs resolution)

---

---

#### Questions to Explore in Class 2.2

- [x] ‚úÖ Which checkpoint sync URL works reliably for Sepolia + Lighthouse v6.0.1? **RESOLVED: v8.0.0-rc.2 needed, not v6.0.1**
- [x] ‚úÖ How long does genesis sync actually take on Sepolia? **N/A - checkpoint sync works with v8.0.0-rc.2**
- [x] ‚úÖ Should we upgrade Lighthouse to a newer version? **YES - upgraded to v8.0.0-rc.2**
- [x] ‚úÖ What's the difference between "snap sync" (Geth) and checkpoint sync (Lighthouse)? **Learned in Class 2.2**
- [x] ‚úÖ How do we know when the node is fully synced? **`eth_syncing` returns `false`**
- [x] ‚úÖ What RPC endpoints can we query once synced? **Explored in Class 2.2**

---

### Week 2, Class 2.2: Node Operations and Monitoring - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Context:** Continuing from Class 2.1 with both Geth v1.16.5 and Lighthouse v8.0.0-rc.2 installed and checkpoint sync working

**Duration:** ~1.5 hours (2025-10-29, 10:29 AM - 12:07 PM)

---

#### Running Geth and Lighthouse Together

**Terminal Setup:**
- Used Windows Terminal with multiple tabs (Option A)
- Terminal 1: Geth (execution client)
- Terminal 2: Lighthouse (consensus client)
- Terminal 3: Query/management terminal

**User Question:** "When I start a new terminal, doesn't mean I'm starting a new server, right?"
- ‚úÖ Correct understanding: New terminal = new connection to same WSL instance
- Analogy: Same house, different windows

**Geth Startup:**
```bash
geth --sepolia --datadir ~/ethereum/sepolia/geth --authrpc.jwtsecret ~/ethereum/sepolia/jwt/jwtsecret --http --http.api eth,net,web3 --syncmode snap
```

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ JWT secret loaded
- ‚úÖ HTTP server started (127.0.0.1:8545)
- ‚úÖ Authenticated Engine API (127.0.0.1:8551)
- ‚úÖ P2P networking started

**Lighthouse Startup:**
```bash
lighthouse bn --network sepolia --datadir ~/ethereum/sepolia/lighthouse --execution-endpoint http://localhost:8551 --execution-jwt ~/ethereum/sepolia/jwt/jwtsecret --checkpoint-sync-url https://checkpoint-sync.sepolia.ethpandaops.io
```

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Connected to Geth successfully (no more "connection refused"!)
- ‚úÖ Checkpoint state loaded from disk
- ‚úÖ 7 peers connected initially
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Unsupported fork" warnings (Osaka fork - expected with v8.0.0-rc.2 + Geth v1.16.5)

---

#### Understanding "Syncing" Concept

**User Question:** "Explain what does it mean to be syncing... I'm a node on the ethereum network? Not quite, right?"

**Key Clarification:**
- ‚úÖ **You ARE a node** (connected to network, 16 peers)
- ‚úÖ Downloading blockchain data
- ‚úÖ Verifying cryptographic proofs
- ‚ùå **Can't reliably answer queries yet** (data incomplete)
- ‚ùå **Not a validator** (no 32 ETH stake, not producing blocks)

**Node Types Learned:**
1. **Full Node** (you, when synced) - validates blocks, queries data, no rewards
2. **Archive Node** - stores ALL history (terabytes)
3. **Validator** - full node + 32 ETH stake + validator keys = earns rewards

**Syncing Process:**
```
Checkpoint (started at slot 8,833,248)
    ‚Üì
Downloading blocks forward
    ‚Üì
Geth verifying execution payloads (catching up)
    ‚Üì
Lighthouse ahead (optimistic sync)
    ‚Üì
FULLY SYNCED (goal)
```

---

#### Data Directory Exploration

**Geth Directory Size:**
- Initial: 73GB at ~42% sync
- Projected final: ~100-150GB (Sepolia full node)

**Lighthouse Directory Size:**
- 2.0GB (consensus data)

**Ratio:** Geth uses **36.5√ó more space** than Lighthouse!

**Why the difference:**
- **Geth (Execution):** Account balances, smart contract storage, transaction history, contract bytecode, receipts
- **Lighthouse (Consensus):** Beacon blocks, attestations, validator votes, finality checkpoints

**Analogy:**
- Geth = Entire company database (all customer data, transactions)
- Lighthouse = Meeting minutes (who voted yes/no)

**Discovery:** `du -sh` can fail on active database (`.sst` files being compacted)
- Solution: `du -sh ~/ethereum/sepolia/geth/ 2>/dev/null` (suppress errors)

---

#### Sync Modes Explained

**Three Geth Sync Modes:**

1. **Full Sync** (slowest)
   - Time: Weeks to months
   - Disk: ~1TB+ (mainnet)
   - Replays EVERY transaction since 2015

2. **Fast Sync** (deprecated)
   - Time: Days
   - Disk: ~500GB
   - Downloads recent state + some history

3. **Snap Sync** (what we're using!)
   - Time: 4-12 hours (Sepolia)
   - Disk: 100-150GB
   - Downloads latest snapshot + forward sync
   - **Like cliff notes + latest updates**

**User insight:** "It's a snapshot synchronization that runs faster" ‚úÖ

**Snap Sync Data Stored:**
- ‚úÖ Block headers (all blocks, back to genesis)
- ‚úÖ Block bodies (transactions)
- ‚úÖ Recent state snapshot (current balances, storage)
- ‚ùå Historical state (can't query old balances)

**Testing:**
```bash
curl eth_getBlockByNumber("0x1")  # Block #1 - SUCCESS!
```
Result: You have block data, but not historical state replay capability.

---

#### Peer Discovery and Networking

**Peer Count Check:**
```bash
curl eth_peerCount ‚Üí "0x10" (16 peers in hex)
```

**Admin Commands Security:**
```bash
curl admin_peers ‚Üí Error: "method does not exist/is not available"
```

**Why blocked over HTTP:**
- HTTP can be exposed to network (remote access)
- Admin commands only via IPC (local-only)
- Security principle: Admin operations require "physical" access

**Using IPC (geth attach):**
```bash
geth attach ~/ethereum/sepolia/geth/geth.ipc
> admin.peers.length
16
```

**Key Difference:**
- **HTTP (curl):** JSON-RPC formatting, remote possible, limited APIs, good for scripts
- **IPC (geth attach):** Interactive JavaScript console, local-only, full admin access, great for debugging

---

#### Systemd Services Setup

**Created Service Files:**

**1. Geth Service (`/etc/systemd/system/geth-sepolia.service`):**
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Geth Ethereum Node (Sepolia)
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=vitor
ExecStart=/usr/bin/geth --sepolia --datadir /home/vitor/ethereum/sepolia/geth ...
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**User insight:** "`Restart=on-failure` will restart if something happens" ‚úÖ

**2. Lighthouse Service (`/etc/systemd/system/lighthouse-sepolia.service`):**
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Lighthouse Beacon Node (Sepolia)
After=network.target
Wants=geth-sepolia.service  # Soft dependency

[Service]
Type=simple
User=vitor
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/lighthouse bn --network sepolia ...
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**User insight:** "`Wants=geth-sepolia.service` because it depends on it" ‚úÖ

**Dependency Types:**
- `Wants=` - Soft dependency (start anyway, wait for Geth)
- `Requires=` - Hard dependency (don't start without it)

**Service Management:**
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload          # Reload service definitions
sudo systemctl start geth-sepolia     # Start service
sudo systemctl status geth-sepolia    # Check status
sudo systemctl enable geth-sepolia    # Auto-start on boot
sudo journalctl -u geth-sepolia -f    # Follow live logs
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Auto-start on boot
- ‚úÖ Auto-restart on crash
- ‚úÖ Run in background (no terminal needed)
- ‚úÖ Simple management commands

---

#### Helper Script Creation

**Created `~/ethereum/node-manager.sh`:**
- start/stop/restart commands
- status checks for both nodes
- sync progress (with jq formatting)
- live log viewing
- Help menu

**Made executable:**
```bash
chmod +x ~/ethereum/node-manager.sh
```

**User insight:** "to be executable" ‚úÖ (chmod +x adds execute permission)

**Optional alias setup:**
```bash
echo 'alias nodes="~/ethereum/node-manager.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**How it works:**
- `echo ... >> ~/.bashrc` - Appends alias to bash config (doesn't overwrite)
- `source ~/.bashrc` - Reloads config in current session (no new terminal needed)
- `>>` vs `>` - Append vs overwrite

**Result:** Simple commands like `nodes status`, `nodes sync`, `nodes logs-geth`

---

#### Sync Progress Throughout Session

**Progression:**
- Start (10:29): ~36% (3,422,195 / 9,515,090 blocks)
- +5 min: 42% (3,957,446 blocks)
- +10 min: 47% (4,455,186 blocks)
- +20 min: 49% (4,662,569 blocks)
- End (12:07): **~56%** (5,301,214 / 9,515,525 blocks)

**Gained: 20% progress in ~1.5 hours**

**Non-linear sync pattern observed:**
- Early: 6% gain in 10 minutes
- Middle: 5% gain in 5 minutes
- Later: 2% gain in 10 minutes
- Slowing down as expected (recent blocks more complex)

**Disk Usage:**
- Geth: 73GB at 42% sync
- Projected: ~100-150GB when complete

---

#### Technical Concepts Mastered

**1. Execution vs Consensus Split**
- **Why:** Resilience (client diversity), modularity (easier upgrades), separation of concerns
- **Analogy:** Geth (worker processing transactions) + Lighthouse (manager deciding validity)

**2. Optimistic Sync**
- Lighthouse accepts blocks before Geth fully verifies them
- "Head is optimistic" warning = normal during sync
- Once Geth catches up, head becomes "verified"

**3. Checkpoint Sync Benefits**
- Without: Sync from genesis (days/weeks)
- With: Download recent checkpoint + forward sync (hours)
- Tradeoff: Trust checkpoint provider initially, trustless after sync

**4. JWT Authentication**
- Shared secret between Geth and Lighthouse
- Both run as same user (vitor), so both can read JWT file
- `chmod 600` prevents OTHER users/processes from accessing

**5. Blob Data (EIP-4844)**
- Temporary data storage for Layer 2 rollups
- Makes L2s cheaper
- v8.0.0-rc.2 supports it, Geth v1.16.5 doesn't yet
- "Unsupported fork" warnings are non-blocking for learning

---

#### Issues Encountered & Solutions

**Issue 1: Osaka Fork Warnings**
- **Problem:** Recurring "Unsupported fork" errors from both clients
- **Cause:** Lighthouse v8.0.0-rc.2 (Osaka fork support) vs Geth v1.16.5 (no Osaka support)
- **Impact:** None - nodes sync successfully, basic operations work
- **Solution:** Acceptable for learning purposes (Option 1: continue as-is)

**Issue 2: Database File Access During `du` Command**
- **Problem:** `du: cannot access '...038393.sst': No such file or directory`
- **Cause:** Geth actively compacting LevelDB/RocksDB `.sst` files during scan
- **Solution:** `du -sh ~/ethereum/sepolia/geth/ 2>/dev/null` (suppress errors)

---

#### Key User Questions & Insights

**Excellent Questions:**
1. "When I start a new terminal that doesn't mean I'm starting a new server, right?" ‚úÖ Correct understanding
2. "Why will Geth and Lighthouse read the file if only owner can read/write?" (JWT permissions) ‚úÖ Good security thinking
3. "Explain what does it mean to be syncing... I'm a node, not quite right?" ‚úÖ Subtle understanding needed
4. "Because it depends on it" (about `Wants=` directive) ‚úÖ Correct
5. "To be executable" (chmod +x) ‚úÖ Succinct and correct

**Strong Conceptual Understanding:**
- Connected "resilience" to client diversity
- Understood security tradeoffs (checkpoint trust vs speed)
- Grasped IPC vs HTTP security implications
- Recognized non-linear sync progression

---

---

#### Next Steps for Class 2.3

**Before starting Class 2.3:**
- ‚è≥ Wait for full sync (~2-3 more hours from 56%)
- ‚úÖ Check sync status: `nodes sync` or `curl eth_syncing`

**Class 2.3 Activities:**
- Get Sepolia ETH from faucets
- Verify balance using YOUR node (not Etherscan!)
- Understand testnet vs mainnet ETH
- Learn about faucet strategies

**Commands for when resuming:**
```bash
nodes status           # Check if nodes still running
nodes sync             # Check sync progress
nodes logs-geth        # View recent activity
```

---

#### Software/Tools Installed in Class 2.2

- `jq` (JSON formatter) - via `sudo apt install jq`

### Session: 2025-10-29 (Afternoon) - WSL Disk Space Issue & Hybrid Approach Decision

**Context:** Geth sync ran out of disk space at ~56%, causing WSL Ubuntu to become unresponsive

---

#### Issue: WSL Out of Disk Space

**What Happened:**
- Geth syncing consumed available disk space in WSL's virtual disk
- WSL Ubuntu became unresponsive (couldn't connect with `wsl -d Ubuntu`)
- Commands `wsl --terminate Ubuntu` and `wsl --shutdown` hung/froze

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**

1. **Freed 100GB on Windows C: drive** ‚úÖ
   - However, this doesn't directly help WSL's virtual disk (separate file)

2. **Identified WSL processes still running:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Process -Name "*wsl*", "*vmcompute*", "*vmmem*"
   ```
   Found 12 processes: vmcompute, vmmemWSL, wsl (4 instances), wslhost (4 instances), wslrelay, wslservice

3. **Force-killed WSL processes:**
   ```powershell
   Stop-Process -Id 432, 42772, 19884, 26896, 35696, 39444, 2348, 3064, 40068, 40244, 35268, 9840 -Force
   ```
   Successfully stopped most processes, 3 stubborn ones remained initially

4. **Verified WSL stopped cleanly:**
   ```powershell
   wsl --list --verbose
   ```
   Result: Both `docker-desktop` and `Ubuntu` showing `STATE: Stopped` ‚úÖ

5. **Attempted to restart WSL:**
   ```powershell
   wsl -d Ubuntu
   ```
   **Error:** `Failed to attach disk 'ext4.vhdx'... ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION`
   - Virtual disk file still locked by another process
   - File handle not released despite killing processes

**Resolution Strategy:** Physical machine reboot (cleanest way to release file locks)

---

#### Technical Concepts Learned

**1. WSL Virtual Disk Architecture**
- WSL stores Linux filesystem in `ext4.vhdx` (virtual hard disk)
- Location: `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu_...\LocalState\ext4.vhdx`
- Disk space INSIDE WSL is separate from Windows C: drive free space
- Even with 100GB free on C:, WSL's virtual disk can be full

**2. WSL Process Structure**
- `vmcompute` - Manages virtual machine compute resources
- `vmmemWSL` - Virtual machine memory management (71MB working set in our case)
- `wsl` - WSL command instances (multiple can run)
- `wslhost` - Hosts WSL instances
- `wslrelay` - Relays communication between Windows and WSL
- `wslservice` - Core WSL service

**3. File Locking in Windows**
- `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION` = file is open/locked by another process
- Can happen even after processes are killed (file handles not released)
- Reboot is most reliable way to release all file locks

**4. Geth Sync Space Requirements (Reminder)**
- Sepolia testnet: ~100-150GB final size
- At 56% sync: Already consuming ~73GB
- Non-linear growth (recent blocks more complex, more state)

---

#### Hybrid Approach Decision

**User's Decision:** Use hybrid strategy for learning efficiency ‚úÖ

**Phase 1 (Weeks 2-10): Use Infura/Alchemy**
- ‚úÖ No disk space issues
- ‚úÖ Instant access (no sync wait)
- ‚úÖ Focus on smart contract development (Solidity, Hardhat, testing)
- ‚úÖ Always up-to-date blockchain state
- ‚ùå Trade-off: Not fully trustless (relying on RPC provider)

**Phase 2 (Week 11+): Return to Local Node**
- When Go event listener needs direct node access
- More disk space available by then
- Better understanding of why local node matters
- Time to troubleshoot properly

**Rationale:**
- **Learning priority:** Smart contracts > infrastructure (for now)
- **Practical constraints:** Disk space, sync time, WSL complications
- **Portfolio value:** Can demonstrate both approaches
- **Educational:** Understanding trade-offs (sovereignty vs convenience)

---

#### Why Run Local Node vs RPC Provider? (Revisited)

**User Question:** "Why do we want Geth and the other one running locally?"

**Reasons for Local Node:**
1. **Self-sovereignty & Trust** - Verify data yourself, no third-party trust
2. **No Limits** - Query any data without rate limits/API keys
3. **Deep Learning** - Understand infrastructure, P2P, consensus
4. **Portfolio Value** - Shows DevOps skills, node operation experience
5. **Course Needs** - Week 11 event listener, Week 25 MEV protection

**Reasons for RPC Provider (Short-Term):**
1. **No Disk Space Issues** - Provider handles storage
2. **Instant Access** - No sync wait (hours/days)
3. **Focus on Development** - More time on smart contracts
4. **Always Updated** - Provider maintains nodes
5. **Lower Complexity** - Fewer moving parts to troubleshoot

**Decision:** RPC provider now, local node later (pragmatic approach)

---

#### Next Steps After Reboot

**Immediate Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Reboot physical machine (releases ext4.vhdx file lock)
2. ‚úÖ Verify WSL starts: `wsl -d Ubuntu`
3. ‚úÖ Check disk usage: `df -h ~` and `du -sh ~/ethereum/sepolia/geth/`
4. ‚úÖ Delete Geth sync data: `rm -rf ~/ethereum/sepolia/geth/`
   - Frees ~73GB inside WSL virtual disk
   - Keep installation, scripts, and directory structure
5. ‚úÖ Set up Infura account and API key
6. ‚úÖ Test Infura connection with sample RPC call
7. ‚úÖ Continue with Week 2 Class 2.3 (Getting Testnet ETH)

**Files/Tools to Keep:**
- ‚úÖ Geth binary (`/usr/bin/geth`)
- ‚úÖ Lighthouse binary (`/usr/local/bin/lighthouse`)
- ‚úÖ Systemd service files (`/etc/systemd/system/geth-sepolia.service`, `lighthouse-sepolia.service`)
- ‚úÖ Helper script (`~/ethereum/node-manager.sh`)
- ‚úÖ Directory structure (`~/ethereum/sepolia/{geth,lighthouse,jwt}`)
- ‚úÖ JWT secret (`~/ethereum/sepolia/jwt/jwtsecret`)

**Files to Delete:**
- ‚ùå Geth sync data (`~/ethereum/sepolia/geth/` contents - ~73GB)

**Reason:** Infrastructure is ready for Week 11 when we return to local node

---

#### Week 2 Status

- [x] ‚úÖ **Class 2.1:** Installing and Configuring Geth (COMPLETE)
- [x] ‚úÖ **Class 2.2:** Node Operations and Monitoring (COMPLETE)
- [ ] üîú **Class 2.3:** Getting Testnet ETH (PENDING - switching to Infura approach)

**Sync Status:** Abandoned at ~56% due to disk space constraints. Will return to local node in Week 11.

**Current Status:** Awaiting reboot to fix WSL file lock, then switching to Infura/Alchemy for Weeks 2-10.

---

## Session: 2025-10-29 (Evening) - WSL Recovery & Hybrid Approach Implementation

**Context:** Fixed WSL disk space issue, cleaned up 264GB Geth data, set up Alchemy RPC provider

---

#### WSL Recovery & Disk Cleanup - SUCCESS ‚úÖ

**Issue Resolution:**
- ‚úÖ Physical machine reboot successfully released ext4.vhdx file lock
- ‚úÖ WSL Ubuntu now accessible via `wsl -d Ubuntu`
- ‚úÖ 687GB "available" inside WSL (misleading - virtual disk maximum)

**Real Disk Space Situation Discovered:**
- Windows C: drive: **~135GB truly free**
- WSL virtual disk (ext4.vhdx): **275GB** before cleanup
- Geth sync data inside WSL: **264GB** (grew from 73GB at 56% to 264GB before crash!)

**Why the Discrepancy:**
- `df -h` inside WSL shows virtual disk's theoretical maximum (1TB)
- BUT ext4.vhdx can only grow as large as Windows C: drive allows
- This caused the original crash when Geth tried to expand beyond available Windows space

**Cleanup Actions Taken:**
1. ‚úÖ Deleted Geth sync data: `rm -rf ~/ethereum/sepolia/geth/` (264GB freed inside WSL)
2. ‚úÖ Compacted WSL virtual disk using diskpart (PowerShell as Administrator)
3. ‚úÖ **Result:** ext4.vhdx reduced from 275GB ‚Üí **8.17GB** (~267GB reclaimed on Windows!)
4. ‚úÖ Windows C: drive now has **~400GB free** (from 135GB)

**Diskpart Commands Used:**
```powershell
wsl --shutdown
@"
select vdisk file="$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\ext4.vhdx"
attach vdisk readonly
compact vdisk
detach vdisk
"@ | diskpart
```

**Files/Infrastructure Preserved:**
- ‚úÖ Geth binary (`/usr/bin/geth`)
- ‚úÖ Lighthouse binary (`/usr/local/bin/lighthouse`)
- ‚úÖ Systemd service files (`geth-sepolia.service`, `lighthouse-sepolia.service`)
- ‚úÖ Helper script (`~/ethereum/node-manager.sh` with alias)
- ‚úÖ Directory structure (`~/ethereum/sepolia/{geth,lighthouse,jwt}`)
- ‚úÖ JWT secret (`~/ethereum/sepolia/jwt/jwtsecret`)

**Rationale:** Infrastructure ready for Week 11 when we return to local node operations.

---

#### Alchemy RPC Provider Setup - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Decision:** Use Alchemy instead of Infura (Infura owned by ConsenSys/MetaMask - user preferred independent provider)

**Alchemy Account Created:**
- Account: Vitor's Team (Free tier)
- App Name: Vitor's First App
- Network: Ethereum Sepolia
- Dashboard: https://dashboard.alchemy.com

**API Key Storage:**
- ‚úÖ Stored in Hardhat keystore: `npx hardhat keystore set --dev ALCHEMY_API_KEY`
- ‚úÖ Full endpoint URL stored: `https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/McWU4Kx-usN9BdeUinsTO`
- ‚úÖ Verified with `npx hardhat keystore list --dev`

**Hardhat Keystore Contents (Development):**
1. `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` - Wallet private key (from Week 1)
2. `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` - RPC endpoint URL (from Week 1)
3. `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` - Alchemy API endpoint (new)

**Connection Test - SUCCESS:**
```powershell
curl -X POST https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/McWU4Kx-usN9BdeUinsTO `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'
```
**Result:** `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x913621"}`
- Block number: 9,516,577 (Sepolia current height) ‚úÖ

---

#### Wallet Information Retrieved

**Wallet Address:** `0xB09b5449D8BB84312Fbc4293baf122E0e1875736`

**Balance Check via Alchemy:**
```powershell
curl -X POST https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/McWU4Kx-usN9BdeUinsTO `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0xB09b5449D8BB84312Fbc4293baf122E0e1875736","latest"],"id":1}'
```
**Result:** `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0xb1dd9a6a4126950"}`
- Wei: 50,344,326,688,343,376
- **Balance: ~0.0503 SepoliaETH** ‚úÖ

**Sufficient for upcoming weeks!** (No urgent need for more testnet ETH)

---

### Week 2, Class 2.3: Getting Testnet ETH - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Context:** Reviewed faucet strategies from Week 1, confirmed sufficient balance

**Faucet Landscape (2025):**

**‚ùå Most Major Faucets Now Require Mainnet ETH:**
- Alchemy Faucet: Requires 0.001 mainnet ETH (blocked)
- MetaMask Faucet: Requires mainnet ETH + MetaMask connection
- Infura Faucet: Requires mainnet ETH
- **Reason:** Anti-bot/anti-abuse measures

**‚úÖ Working Faucet (No Mainnet ETH Required):**
- **Google Cloud POW Faucet** - Proof-of-Work puzzle (used successfully in Week 1)
- Most reliable free option for testnet ETH
- URL: https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia

**Current Balance Assessment:**
- Current: **~0.05 SepoliaETH**
- Week 2 needs: 0 ETH (only querying data)
- Week 3 needs: ~0.01 ETH (CLI test transactions)
- Weeks 5-6 needs: ~0.01-0.02 ETH (contract deployments)
- **Conclusion:** Sufficient for next 3-4 weeks! ‚úÖ

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Always have backup faucet strategies
2. POW faucets are best for learning (no mainnet ETH barrier)
3. Monitor balance periodically, request more when needed
4. Testnet ETH is free but requires effort (proof-of-work or mainnet ETH proof)

---

#### Technical Concepts Learned (Session Summary)

**1. WSL Virtual Disk Architecture**
- WSL uses `ext4.vhdx` virtual hard disk file on Windows C: drive
- `df -h` inside WSL shows theoretical maximum, NOT Windows available space
- Compacting required after deleting large amounts of data (diskpart on Windows)

**2. API Key vs Private Key Security**
- **Private Key:** Can sign transactions, spend ETH - CRITICAL to protect
- **API Key:** Can read data, uses quota - Less critical but still protect
- **Best Practice:** Store all credentials securely (Hardhat keystore, password managers)

**3. RPC Provider Options**
- **Local Node:** Full sovereignty, no limits, learning value, but requires disk/sync time
- **RPC Provider:** Instant access, no disk usage, always updated, but quota limits/trust
- **Hybrid Approach:** Use RPC provider for learning, local node for specific needs (Week 11+)

**4. Hardhat 3 Keystore Access**
- `hre.vars.get()` doesn't work in scripts the same way as Hardhat 2
- `getSigners()` automatically loads accounts from network config
- Keystore designed to hide values for security (intentional!)

**5. Testnet Faucet Strategies**
- Mainnet ETH requirements are common anti-bot measures (2025 trend)
- POW faucets remain most accessible for developers
- Always have multiple faucet options researched

---

#### Issues Encountered & Solutions

**Issue 1: WSL Out of Disk Space**
- **Problem:** Geth sync consumed 264GB, WSL became unresponsive
- **Root Cause:** Virtual disk tried to grow beyond Windows C: drive available space
- **Solution:** Reboot ‚Üí Delete Geth data ‚Üí Compact virtual disk with diskpart
- **Prevention:** Monitor disk usage with `df -h` AND check Windows free space

**Issue 2: Hardhat Project Location**
- **Problem:** Hardhat commands failed in `FamilyChain/` root directory
- **Resolution:** Hardhat project is in `FamilyChain/blockchain/` subdirectory
- **Learning:** Always run `npx hardhat` commands from directory containing `hardhat.config.ts`

**Issue 3: Viewing Keystore Values**
- **Problem:** Wanted to view stored API key values for verification
- **Attempted Solutions:**
  - Custom Hardhat task (Hardhat 3 API changed, multiple TypeScript errors)
  - Hardhat console (command flags different in Hardhat 3)
- **Conclusion:** Keystore intentionally hides values for security - trust it works!
- **Best Practice:** Keep backup of credentials in separate secure location (password manager)

**Issue 4: Faucets Require Mainnet ETH**
- **Problem:** Alchemy and most faucets require 0.001 mainnet ETH balance
- **Resolution:** Reviewed Week 1 notes - POW faucet worked previously
- **Decision:** Current balance (~0.05 ETH) sufficient for weeks 2-6, no urgent need

---

#### User Learning & Engagement Highlights

**Excellent Questions:**
1. "The disk space is not correct... could you please try to understand why?" ‚úÖ Caught WSL virtual disk vs Windows drive discrepancy
2. "How do I create that script?" (diskpart heredoc) ‚úÖ Asked for clarification on PowerShell syntax
3. "My alchemy_api_key is the whole url?" ‚úÖ Questioned RPC endpoint structure
4. "We installed hardhat on ubuntu, right?" ‚úÖ Remembered where tools were installed
5. "Is that hardhat 2 or hardhat 3?" ‚úÖ Version-aware when seeing code examples
6. "Do I really need more sepolia eth now?" ‚úÖ Pragmatic assessment of actual needs

**Strong Technical Understanding:**
- Identified virtual disk space discrepancy immediately
- Remembered Week 1 faucet strategies without prompting
- Security-conscious (stored credentials outside project)
- Version-aware (Hardhat 3 API differences)
- Pragmatic decision-making (sufficient ETH, no urgent action needed)

**Professional Best Practices:**
- Saved sensitive wallet info OUTSIDE project directory (better than .gitignore)
- Questioned API key security (even though less critical than private key)
- Referenced past learning (Week 1 notes for faucet info)
- Pragmatic approach (hybrid local node / RPC provider strategy)

---

#### Week 2 Status - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ Alchemy RPC working (9.5M blocks queried successfully)
- ‚úÖ Hardhat keystore: 3 keys stored (SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY, SEPOLIA_RPC_URL, ALCHEMY_API_KEY)

---

#### Key Decisions Made This Week

**1. Hybrid Node Approach:**
- **Weeks 2-10:** Use Alchemy RPC provider (instant access, no disk issues)
- **Week 11+:** Return to local Geth node (for event listener, MEV protection)
- **Rationale:** Focus on smart contract development now, infrastructure later

**2. Alchemy over Infura:**
- **Choice:** Alchemy (independent company)
- **Alternative:** Infura (ConsenSys/MetaMask owned)
- **Rationale:** User preferred independent RPC provider

**3. Lighthouse v8.0.0-rc.2 over v6.0.1:**
- **Choice:** Upgraded to v8.0.0-rc.2 during Class 2.2
- **Reason:** Checkpoint sync compatibility (v6.0.1 had SSZ format errors)
- **Result:** Checkpoint sync worked with ethPandaOps endpoint

**4. Testnet ETH Strategy:**
- **Decision:** Use existing ~0.05 ETH, no urgent faucet requests
- **Backup Plan:** Google Cloud POW faucet when more ETH needed
- **Rationale:** Sufficient balance for next 3-4 weeks of development

**5. Credential Storage:**
- **Decision:** Wallet info saved OUTSIDE project directory
- **Alternative:** Could use .gitignore in project
- **Rationale:** Extra safety layer (not relying on .gitignore)

## Session: 2025-10-29 (Late Evening) - Week 2 Self-Assessment & Week 3 Preparation

**Context:** Completed Week 2 self-assessment, prepared all Week 3 class documents

---

### Week 2 Self-Assessment Results

**Score: 5/8 Solid Understanding**

**Strong Areas (‚úÖ):**
1. ‚úÖ Execution vs Consensus split (modularity, client diversity, resilience)
2. ‚úÖ Admin commands security (IPC vs HTTP)
3. ‚úÖ Faucet mainnet ETH requirements (anti-bot measures)
4. ‚úÖ Snap sync understanding (snapshot synchronization)
5. ‚úÖ Checkpoint sync tradeoff (trust vs speed)

**Areas Needing Clarification (‚ö†Ô∏è):**
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è JWT authentication - Authentication not encryption (shared secret for verification)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Checkpoint sync limitation - Misunderstood query capabilities (CAN query old blocks, CANNOT query historical state)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Geth sync modes - Missing "Fast sync" (deprecated third mode)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Node types confused - Full vs Archive (Archive = full + ALL historical state, not "just stores data")
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Backup faucet strategy - Forgot Google Cloud POW faucet (used in Week 1)

**Key Corrections Made:**
- JWT = authentication password, not encryption key
- Checkpoint sync tradeoff = trust vs speed (not query limitations)
- Archive node = full node + complete historical state
- Backup faucet = Google Cloud POW (https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia)

**Overall Assessment:** Strong conceptual foundation, minor details to review. Ready for Week 3! ‚úÖ
