# Week 3 Learning Notes
## Command Line Blockchain Interactions

**Week Duration:** 2025-10-30 (in progress)
**Status:** üîÑ Class 3.1 Complete | Classes 3.2-3.4 Pending

---

## Session: 2025-10-30

### Week 3, Class 3.1: Creating Wallets via CLI - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Context:** Starting Week 3 after completing Week 2 (Running Ethereum Node, hybrid RPC approach with Alchemy)

**Duration:** ~1.5 hours

---

#### Pre-Class: Reading Confirmation

**Week 2 Reading Completed:** ‚úÖ
- Bitcoin Book: Chapter 3 (Bitcoin Core - Running a Node)
- Ethereum Book: Chapter 3 (Clients - Running an Ethereum Client)

---

#### Understanding Check: Private Keys

**User's understanding of private keys:**
- ‚úÖ Private key encrypts messages
- ‚úÖ Public key derived from private key
- ‚úÖ Public key decrypts messages encrypted with private key
- ‚úÖ Private key should be kept hidden/secret

**Refinement provided:**
- In Ethereum, private keys primarily used for **signing transactions** (not encrypting messages)
- Flow: Private Key ‚Üí Public Key ‚Üí Address
- Private key proves ownership and authorizes transactions

---

#### Activity 1: Generate Random Wallet

**File created:** `scripts/week3/create-wallet.ts`

**Key concepts learned:**
- `ethers.Wallet.createRandom()` generates new wallet locally (no blockchain connection needed)
- Every wallet has 3 components:
  - **Mnemonic Phrase** (12 words) - Human-readable backup
  - **Private Key** (64 hex characters) - The actual secret derived from mnemonic
  - **Address** (40 hex characters) - Public account number

**Sample output:**
```
Address: 0x0575DECc2A985F62FF3699dbe1C18d264B9580B9
Private Key: 0x5e81cc318f8873dcb31d7af250348c7e3030170ebedfd574814e89bc84c7dbc6
Mnemonic: enemy build tired soup nuclear company dawn garbage unfair gift target seat
```

**User insight:** Can't reverse engineer private key from address (one-way cryptography)

---

#### Activity 2: Recover Wallet from Mnemonic

**File created:** `scripts/week3/wallet-from-mnemonic.ts`

**Key concept demonstrated:**
- Same mnemonic phrase ‚Üí Same private key ‚Üí Same address (deterministic)
- This is how wallet recovery works in MetaMask and other wallets
- **Proof:** Recreated exact same wallet from 12-word phrase

**HD Wallets concept introduced:**
- One mnemonic can generate infinite addresses (Account 1, 2, 3...)
- Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet pattern
- MetaMask uses this for multiple accounts from single backup

---

#### Activity 3: Connect Wallet to Blockchain

**File created:** `scripts/week3/wallet-with-provider.ts`

**Major challenge:** Hardhat 3 API differences from Hardhat 2

**Issues encountered:**

1. **First attempt:** `hre.vars.get()` doesn't exist in Hardhat 3
2. **Second attempt:** `ethers.provider` (from "hardhat" import) doesn't exist
3. **Third attempt:** `hre.network.config.url` - property doesn't exist on NetworkManager
4. **Fourth attempt:** `vars` not exported from "hardhat" module
5. **Fifth attempt:** `vars` not exported from "hardhat/config" module
6. **Sixth attempt:** `configVariable()` returns ConfigurationVariable type (not string)

**Final solution (after web research):**
```typescript
import { network } from "hardhat";

const connection = await network.connect();
const provider = connection.ethers.provider;
```

**Hardhat 3 key change:**
- **Must explicitly connect to network:** `await network.connect()`
- Provider accessed via `connection.ethers.provider`
- Very different from Hardhat 2's `hre.ethers.provider`

**Successful output:**
```
Wallet Address: 0x0575DECc2A985F62FF3699dbe1C18d264B9580B9
Balance: 0.0 ETH
‚úÖ Successfully connected to Sepolia testnet!
```

**Important clarification: Sepolia vs Alchemy**

**User question:** "How do Sepolia and Alchemy compare? Is Alchemy a type of Sepolia network?"

**Answer provided:**
- **Sepolia** = The blockchain network (Ethereum testnet)
- **Alchemy** = RPC service provider (access point to Sepolia)
- **Analogy:** Sepolia = Internet, Alchemy = ISP

**Relationship:**
```
Your Code
    ‚Üì
Alchemy's API (https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/...)
    ‚Üì
Alchemy's Sepolia Node (they run Geth/Lighthouse)
    ‚Üì
Sepolia Testnet (the actual blockchain)
```

**Configuration update:**
- Updated `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` keystore variable to use Alchemy endpoint
- Command: `npx hardhat keystore set --dev --force SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`
- Value: `https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/McWU4Kx-usN9BdeUinsTO`

---

#### Activity 4: Load Existing Wallet

**File created:** `scripts/week3/load-existing-wallet.ts`

**Challenge:** How to access keystore variables in Hardhat 3 scripts?

**Attempted approaches:**
1. `vars.get()` from "hardhat" - ‚ùå Not exported
2. `vars.get()` from "hardhat/config" - ‚ùå Not exported
3. `configVariable()` - ‚ùå Returns wrong type (ConfigurationVariable, not string)

**Final solution:** Use Hardhat's built-in signers
```typescript
const [signer] = await connection.ethers.getSigners();
```

**Why this works:**
- `getSigners()` loads accounts from `hardhat.config.ts`
- Config already has `accounts: [configVariable("SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY")]`
- Hardhat automatically resolves private key and creates signer

**Successful output:**
```
Wallet Address: 0xB09b5449D8BB84312Fbc4293baf122E0e1875736
Balance: 0.80103561848228488 SepoliaETH
‚úÖ This is your REAL wallet with actual testnet ETH!
```

**Discovery:** Balance increased from ~0.05 ETH to 0.80 ETH (user must have used faucet)

---

#### Key User Question: Multiple Wallets/Connections

**User insight:** "In Hardhat 3 you're supposed to always assume you're using things from configuration, but that seems strange. What if I wanted to have 2 different wallets or connections?"

**Answer provided:**

**Option 1: Multiple configured accounts**
```typescript
const [account1, account2, account3] = await connection.ethers.getSigners();
```

**Option 2: Create wallets dynamically**
```typescript
const randomWallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom().connect(provider);
const wallet2 = ethers.Wallet.fromPhrase("mnemonic").connect(provider);
const wallet3 = new ethers.Wallet("0xPRIVATE_KEY", provider);
```

**Option 3: Multiple network connections**
```typescript
const sepoliaConnection = await network.connect();
const mainnetConnection = await network.connect({ network: "mainnet" });
```

**Design philosophy:**
- Config-based = Convenient for common cases
- Manual creation = Flexible when needed
- **Best practice:** Use `getSigners()` for main accounts, create additional wallets dynamically when needed

---

#### Technical Concepts Learned

**1. Wallet Components**
- **Mnemonic** (12 words) ‚Üí Human-readable backup
- **Private Key** (256-bit number) ‚Üí The actual secret
- **Address** (derived from public key) ‚Üí Public account identifier

**2. Deterministic Wallet Recovery**
- Same mnemonic always produces same private key/address
- BIP-39 standard for mnemonic ‚Üí seed conversion
- Used by all major wallets (MetaMask, Ledger, etc.)

**3. HD Wallets (Hierarchical Deterministic)**
- One mnemonic can generate infinite addresses
- Each address at different derivation path
- Enables "Account 1", "Account 2", etc. from single backup

**4. Local vs Blockchain Operations**
- **Local (no connection needed):** Wallet creation, key derivation
- **Blockchain query needed:** Balance checks, transaction history, sending transactions

**5. Hardhat 3 Network Connection Pattern**
```typescript
import { network } from "hardhat";
const connection = await network.connect();
const provider = connection.ethers.provider;
```

**6. Provider vs Signer**
- **Provider:** Read-only connection to blockchain (queries)
- **Signer:** Provider + private key (can sign transactions)

---

#### Issues Encountered & Solutions

**Issue 1: Hardhat 3 API Documentation Confusion**
- **Problem:** Multiple attempts using incorrect Hardhat 2 patterns
- **Root cause:** Hardhat 3 has significant API changes
- **Learning:** Always verify documentation version before implementation
- **User feedback:** "Be sure to always look in the correct version of the documentation first to avoid these errors"

**Issue 2: Accessing Configuration Variables in Scripts**
- **Problem:** `vars.get()` not available in Hardhat 3 scripts
- **Attempted solutions:** Import from "hardhat", "hardhat/config", use `configVariable()`
- **Final solution:** Use `getSigners()` which auto-loads configured accounts
- **Rationale:** Hardhat 3 encourages config-based approach for main accounts

**Issue 3: Understanding Sepolia vs Alchemy Relationship**
- **Problem:** User unsure if Alchemy is "a type of Sepolia network"
- **Clarification:** Sepolia = blockchain network, Alchemy = RPC provider (access layer)
- **Analogy:** Internet vs ISP relationship
- **Resolution:** Clear understanding of network vs access provider

---

#### User Learning & Engagement Highlights

**Excellent Questions:**
1. "Where is .then and .catch defined? Are those JavaScript keywords? This relates to chaining, right?" ‚úÖ Promise methods
2. "We are using npx because we just want to run the script?" ‚úÖ Correct understanding
3. "Tell me about the ethers import. Is it official? Are there others?" ‚úÖ Exploring alternatives
4. "When I ran this did Hardhat connect to Ethereum or testnet?" ‚úÖ Understanding connection timing
5. "Should I use my previous wallet that had 0.05 ETH?" ‚úÖ Practical thinking
6. "How do Sepolia and Alchemy compare? Is Alchemy a type of Sepolia?" ‚úÖ Clarifying architecture
7. "What if I wanted to have 2 different wallets or connections?" ‚úÖ Questioning design limitations

**Strong Technical Understanding:**
- Understood Promise chaining and async/await patterns
- Questioned ethers.js vs web3.js alternatives
- Recognized when blockchain connection happens (vs local operations)
- Caught documentation version issues immediately
- Pushed back when solutions seemed overly restrictive

**Professional Best Practices:**
- Asked for documentation URLs to verify independently
- Insisted on checking correct Hardhat 3 documentation
- Questioned design decisions (config-based approach)
- Verified understanding before moving forward

---

#### Hardhat 3 Key Learnings (Critical for Future Classes)

**Network Connection (NEW in Hardhat 3):**
```typescript
import { network } from "hardhat";
const connection = await network.connect();
const provider = connection.ethers.provider;
```

**Getting Signers:**
```typescript
const [signer] = await connection.ethers.getSigners();
// Auto-loads accounts from hardhat.config.ts
```

**Configuration Variables:**
- **In config file:** `configVariable("KEY_NAME")`
- **In scripts:** Access via `getSigners()` (for accounts) or environment
- **NOT available:** `vars.get()` pattern from Hardhat 2

**Provider Access:**
- **Hardhat 2:** `hre.ethers.provider`
- **Hardhat 3:** `connection.ethers.provider` (after `await network.connect()`)

---

## Session: 2025-10-31

### Week 3, Class 3.2: Sending Your First Transaction - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Duration:** ~2 hours

**Context:** Continuing from Class 3.1 (wallet creation). Learning to send transactions, estimate gas, check status, and handle errors.

---

#### Pre-Class: MCP Tools Integration

**CLAUDE.md Updated with MCP Guidelines:**
- Added comprehensive MCP tools usage section
- context7 MCP for documentation lookup
- chrome-devtools MCP for frontend debugging (Week 6+)
- playwright MCP for E2E testing (Week 27)
- Updated "Preparing Classes" section with step-by-step MCP workflow
- Added "Troubleshooting with MCPs" section

**Key additions:**
- Always query version-specific documentation
- Use context7 BEFORE teaching new library/tool
- Proactive documentation checking prevents errors

---

#### Activity 1: Send ETH Between Wallets

**Initial confusion: Local vs Sepolia network**

**Issue encountered:**
- Script ran successfully but used **local Hardhat network** instead of Sepolia
- Clues: Address `0xf39Fd...` (Hardhat's default), 10,000 ETH balance, Block #1, instant confirmation

**Root cause:** Using `npx tsx` instead of `npx hardhat run`
- `tsx` doesn't understand `--network` flag
- Hardhat runner required for network selection

**Solution:**
```powershell
npx hardhat run scripts/week3/send-transaction.ts --network sepolia
```

**Successful transaction:**
- **Hash:** `0x85324acc9e53f71dc1649839db5b33e620eadbdb295f5cc949443c7f084042fa`
- **From:** 0xB09b...5736 (real wallet)
- **To:** 0x310a9...30B5 (random wallet)
- **Amount:** 0.001 ETH
- **Block:** 9,531,070
- **Gas Used:** 21,000
- **Gas Cost:** 0.0000315 ETH (~1.5 gwei)
- **Total Cost:** 0.001031500... ETH

**Key learning:**
- Gas is real - always adds to transaction cost
- 21,000 gas is fixed for simple ETH transfers
- Transaction confirmed in ~15-30 seconds on Sepolia
- Funds sent to random wallet are effectively "lost" (no private key)

---

#### Activity 2: Estimate Gas Before Sending

**Script created:** `scripts/week3/estimate-gas.ts`

**Key concepts demonstrated:**
- `provider.estimateGas()` - Simulates transaction, returns gas units needed
- `provider.getFeeData()` - Gets current network gas prices (EIP-1559)
- Total cost calculation: `amount + (gasLimit √ó gasPrice)`
- Balance check before sending

**Execution results:**
- Estimated Gas Limit: 21,000 (as expected)
- Gas Price: **0.001 gwei** (extremely low!)
- Total Cost: 0.010000021 ETH (to send 0.01 ETH)

**Gas price comparison:**
- Activity 1 (sent): 1.5 gwei
- Activity 2 (estimated): 0.001 gwei
- **1,500x difference in ~30 minutes!** (typical testnet volatility)

**User insight:** Understanding why gas estimation matters:
1. Know total cost before sending
2. Avoid insufficient funds errors
3. Monitor network conditions (postpone if gas is high)
4. Validate transaction will succeed

---

#### Activity 3: Check Transaction Status

**Script created:** `scripts/week3/check-transaction.ts`

**Key concepts:**
- `getTransaction(hash)` - Returns what you **sent** (from, to, value, gas limit, nonce)
- `getTransactionReceipt(hash)` - Returns what **happened** (block number, gas used, status, logs)
- Confirmations = current block - transaction block

**Execution results:**
- Transaction Hash: 0x85324acc... (from Activity 1)
- Nonce: 1 (this was the 2nd transaction from the wallet)
- Block Number: 9,531,070
- **Confirmations: 174** (Very Safe!)
- Current Block: 9,531,244
- Time passed: ~174 blocks √ó 12 sec = ~35 minutes

**User question about block numbers:**
"Why does receipt have a block number? Is it different from transaction block number?"

**Answer:** They're the **same** block number!
- `tx.blockNumber` = where transaction was mined
- `receipt.blockNumber` = same block (where execution results are recorded)
- Both refer to block 9,531,070
- Different objects (Transaction vs Receipt), same block reference

**Analogy provided:** Order (transaction) vs Receipt (result) - both reference same delivery address

**Confirmations concept:**
- 1 confirmation: Included in 1 block
- 6 confirmations: Generally safe (exchanges use this)
- 12+ confirmations: Very safe
- 174 confirmations: Extremely safe (practically irreversible)

---

#### Activity 4: Handle Transaction Errors

**Script created:** `scripts/week3/handle-errors.ts`

**Tests performed:**
1. **Insufficient funds** - Caught "bad address checksum" (ethers.js validates address first!)
2. **Invalid address** - Caught "ENS resolution requires a provider" (ethers tried to resolve as ENS name)
3. **Gas estimation** - ‚úÖ Successful (21,000 gas)
4. **Nonce check** - Current nonce: 2 (confirms 2 transactions sent total)

**Unexpected error messages (different from guide):**
- Test 1: Got "bad address checksum" instead of "insufficient funds"
  - **Why:** ethers.js validates address format BEFORE checking balance
  - **This is good:** Catches address errors early

- Test 2: Got "ENS resolution requires a provider" instead of "invalid address"
  - **Why:** ethers.js tried to resolve "0xinvalid" as ENS name
  - **Still caught:** Error handling worked correctly

**Key concept:** `try/catch` blocks protect code from crashing when errors occur

**Transaction history confirmed:**
- Nonce 0: First transaction (before Class 3.2)
- Nonce 1: Activity 1 transaction (0x85324acc...)
- Nonce 2: Next transaction will use this

---

#### Class 3.2 Deliverables - ALL COMPLETE ‚úÖ

- [x] 4 working scripts: `send-transaction.ts`, `estimate-gas.ts`, `check-transaction.ts`, `handle-errors.ts`
- [x] Sent successful transaction on Sepolia (0x85324acc...)
- [x] Transaction verified on Etherscan (174 confirmations)
- [x] Understanding of gas mechanics (21,000 gas, variable prices)
- [x] Understanding of transaction lifecycle (pending ‚Üí mined ‚Üí confirmed)
- [x] Understanding of nonce (sequential counter: 0, 1, 2...)
- [x] Understanding of confirmations (depth in blockchain)

---

### Week 3, Class 3.3: Querying Blockchain Data - IN PROGRESS üîÑ

**Duration so far:** ~15 minutes

**Context:** Learning to query blockchain as a public database - balances, blocks, transactions, real-time monitoring.

---

#### Activity 1: Query Account Balances - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Script created:** `scripts/week3/query-balances.ts`

**Hardhat 3 Pattern Correction:**
- **Initial mistake:** Used `hre.vars.get("ALCHEMY_API_KEY")` (Hardhat 2 syntax)
- **User caught it:** "that feels hardhat 2 to me and not hardhat 3"
- **Corrected pattern:**
  ```typescript
  import { network } from "hardhat";
  const connection = await network.connect();
  const provider = connection.ethers.provider;
  ```

**Key concept:** `await network.connect()` automatically uses network config from `hardhat.config.ts` (including RPC URL via `configVariable()`)

**Execution results (Sepolia testnet):**
- Your Wallet (0xB09b...5736): 0.80000411 ETH
- Vitalik Buterin: 34.3 ETH
- Ethereum Foundation: 4.5 ETH
- Current Block: 9,531,360

**User question:** "but these are balances on sepolia testnet, right?"

**Answer:** Yes! These are testnet balances (no real value)
- Testnet ETH = play money
- Mainnet balances are very different:
  - Vitalik: ~3,700+ ETH ($7+ million)
  - Ethereum Foundation: ~300,000+ ETH ($600+ million)

**Key concept learned:** Blockchain is a **public database** - anyone can query any address balance without needing private keys!

---

#### Session Break Point

**Paused at:** Class 3.3, Activity 1 complete

**Next activities when resuming:**
- Activity 2: Explore block data (fetch block details, calculate utilization)
- Activity 3: Get transaction history (using Etherscan API - requires API key)
- Activity 4: Monitor real-time blockchain (watch new blocks arrive)

---

### Files Created This Session

**Class 3.2 Scripts:**
- `scripts/week3/send-transaction.ts` - Send ETH between wallets
- `scripts/week3/estimate-gas.ts` - Calculate transaction costs before sending
- `scripts/week3/check-transaction.ts` - Query transaction details and confirmations
- `scripts/week3/handle-errors.ts` - Error handling patterns

**Class 3.3 Scripts:**
- `scripts/week3/query-balances.ts` - Query account balances

**Documentation:**
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with comprehensive MCP tools usage guidelines

---

### Key Technical Learnings

**Hardhat 3 Patterns:**
1. Use `npx hardhat run` with `--network` flag (NOT `npx tsx`)
2. Use `await network.connect()` for provider access
3. Use `connection.ethers.getSigners()` for configured accounts
4. Provider auto-configured from `hardhat.config.ts`

**Transaction Mechanics:**
- Total cost = amount + (gas units √ó gas price)
- Simple ETH transfers = exactly 21,000 gas
- Gas prices fluctuate (saw 1.5 gwei ‚Üí 0.001 gwei in 30 min)
- Confirmations = current block - transaction block
- Nonce = sequential transaction counter per address

**Error Handling:**
- ethers.js validates addresses before balance checks
- Always use `try/catch` for transaction operations
- Estimation simulates transaction (catches failures before sending)

**Blockchain Querying:**
- Everything is public except private keys
- `provider.getBalance()` works for ANY address
- Testnet vs mainnet balances are completely separate

---

### Questions Explored

1. **JavaScript object nesting:** Understanding `connection.ethers.provider`
   - `connection` has property `ethers`
   - `ethers` has property `provider`
   - Like `car.engine.horsepower`

2. **Transaction vs Receipt block numbers:** Both reference same block
   - Transaction = what you sent
   - Receipt = what happened
   - Same block, different purposes

3. **Gas estimation purpose:** Know cost before sending, avoid failures, check network conditions

4. **Testnet vs Mainnet:** Completely separate networks with different balances

---

### User Learning Strengths Observed

- **Excellent version awareness:** Caught Hardhat 2 vs 3 syntax differences immediately
- **Asks for concept explanations:** "explain the concepts, not just the code"
- **Connects learning:** Gas estimation ‚Üí postponing transactions if prices high
- **Questions underlying mechanisms:** Block numbers, nonce, why estimate gas
- **Verifies understanding:** "but these are balances on sepolia testnet, right?"

---

**Total Time Invested (Class 3.2 + Class 3.3 start):** ~2.5 hours
- Class 3.2: ~2 hours (4 activities)
- Class 3.3: ~15 minutes (Activity 1 only)

**Class 3.2 Status:** ‚úÖ **FULLY COMPLETE**
**Class 3.3 Status:** üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** (Activity 1 of 4 complete)
