# Week 1, Class 1.1: Minimal Development Environment Setup
## FamilyChain Course - Learning Guide

---

## üéØ Overview

**Duration:** 1-2 hours
**Prerequisites:**
- Windows computer with administrator access
- Internet connection
- Basic familiarity with command line

**Philosophy:**
This class follows the "just-in-time installation" approach. We install ONLY what's needed for Week 1. You won't install PostgreSQL, Docker, or other tools until you actually need them.

**Why This Matters:**
Setting up your development environment correctly now prevents hours of debugging later. These tools form the foundation for blockchain development.

---

## üìö Learning Objectives

By the end of this class, you will be able to:

1. **Install and verify** Git for version control
2. **Install and configure** Node.js v22.14.0+ and npm 11.6.2+
3. **Set up** VS Code with essential blockchain development extensions
4. **Navigate** PowerShell command line confidently
5. **Verify** all installations are working correctly
6. **Understand** why each tool is needed in blockchain development

---

## üìñ Key Concepts

### 1. Why These Tools?

| Tool | Purpose | When You'll Use It |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Git** | Version control | Track code changes, collaborate, deploy |
| **Node.js** | JavaScript runtime | Run Hardhat, ethers.js, API servers |
| **npm** | Package manager | Install Hardhat, libraries, dependencies |
| **VS Code** | Code editor | Write Solidity, JavaScript, TypeScript |
| **Extensions** | IDE enhancement | Syntax highlighting, error detection, formatting |
| **PowerShell** | Command line | Run commands, scripts, interact with blockchain |

### 2. Version Requirements

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Versions Matter!**

This course uses specific versions. Don't just install "latest" without checking:

- **Node.js:** v22.14.0 or higher (LTS version)
- **npm:** 11.6.2 or higher (included with Node.js)
- **Git:** 2.38.1 or higher
- **VS Code:** Latest stable version

**Why specific versions?**
- Hardhat 3 requires Node.js v18+
- ethers.js v6 has breaking changes from v5
- Older Node.js versions may have security vulnerabilities

### 3. PowerShell Basics

You'll use PowerShell throughout this course. Here are essential commands:

```powershell
# Check current directory
pwd

# List files in directory
ls

# Change directory
cd path\to\folder

# Create directory
mkdir folder-name

# Clear screen
clear

# Check command version
node --version
git --version
```

   - Go to: https://git-scm.com/download/win
   - Download the 64-bit standalone installer

2. **Run the installer:**
   - Accept default settings (just click "Next" through everything)
   - **Important:** Keep "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"
   - Keep "Use bundled OpenSSH"
   - Keep "Use the OpenSSL library"

3. **Verify installation:**

Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
git --version
```

**Expected output:**
```
git version 2.38.1.windows.1
```
(Your version may be slightly different - that's fine as long as it's 2.38+)

4. **Configure Git:**

```powershell
# Set your name (used in commits)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set your email
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Verify configuration
git config --list
```

**Expected output:**
```
user.name=Your Name
user.email=your.email@example.com
... (more settings)
```

**‚úÖ Success Criteria:**
- `git --version` shows version 2.38+
- `git config --list` shows your name and email

---

### Step 2: Install Node.js and npm (20 minutes)

**What is Node.js?**
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser. You'll use it to:
- Run Hardhat (smart contract development framework)

**npm (Node Package Manager)** comes bundled with Node.js and installs JavaScript libraries.

**Installation:**

1. **Download Node.js:**
   - Go to: https://nodejs.org/en/download
   - Download "22.14.0 LTS" for Windows (64-bit)
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Get v22.14.0 or higher, NOT v18 or v20

2. **Run the installer:**
   - Accept license agreement
   - Keep default installation path: `C:\Program Files\nodejs\`
   - **Important:** Check "Automatically install necessary tools" (includes build tools)
   - Click "Install"

3. **Restart PowerShell:**
   - Close any open PowerShell windows
   - Open a fresh PowerShell window
   - This ensures the PATH is updated

4. **Verify installation:**

```powershell
# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Check npm version
npm --version
```

**Expected output:**
```
v22.14.0
11.6.2
```

**If versions are lower than expected:**
```powershell
# Update npm to latest
npm install -g npm@latest

# Verify new version
npm --version
```

**Test Node.js works:**
```powershell
# Run a simple JavaScript command
node -e "console.log('Node.js is working!')"
```

**Expected output:**
```
Node.js is working!
```

**‚úÖ Success Criteria:**
- `node --version` shows v22.14.0 or higher
- `npm --version` shows 11.6.2 or higher
- `node -e "console.log('test')"` prints "test"

} else {
    Write-Host "‚ùå Git not found" -ForegroundColor Red
}

# Node.js
Write-Host "`nChecking Node.js..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
$nodeVersion = node --version
Write-Host $nodeVersion
if ($nodeVersion -match "v(\d+)\.") {
    $major = [int]$matches[1]
    if ($major -ge 22) {
        Write-Host "‚úÖ Node.js version OK (v22+)" -ForegroundColor Green
    } else {
        Write-Host "‚ö†Ô∏è  Node.js version too old (need v22+)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    }
}

# npm
Write-Host "`nChecking npm..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
$npmVersion = npm --version
Write-Host $npmVersion
if ($npmVersion -match "(\d+)\.") {
    $major = [int]$matches[1]
    if ($major -ge 11) {
        Write-Host "‚úÖ npm version OK (v11+)" -ForegroundColor Green
    } else {
        Write-Host "‚ö†Ô∏è  npm version too old (need v11+)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    }
}

# VS Code
Write-Host "`nChecking VS Code..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
code --version
if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
    Write-Host "‚úÖ VS Code installed" -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "‚ùå VS Code not found" -ForegroundColor Red
}

Write-Host "`n=== Verification Complete ===" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "If all checks passed, you're ready for Class 1.2!" -ForegroundColor Green
