## Session: 2025-01-17

### Questions & Decisions

**Q1: Course Plan Review**
- **Question:** Read first_thought.md and provide feedback on the learning project idea
- **Context:** Reviewing the initial conversation about building a blockchain project to learn crypto development
- **Key Insight:** The pivot from complex "DEX Aggregator" to "FamilyChain" (family finance) made the project more relatable and immediately applicable

**Q2: Course Structure**
- **Question:** Create a comprehensive course plan that works both as personal learning roadmap and as course material for others
- **Context:** Need to structure the project into a teachable format
- **Decision:** Created 20-module course over 4 phases (Foundation ‚Üí Core ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Production)
- **Deliverable:** COURSE_PLAN.md created

**Q3: Environment Setup Philosophy**
- **Question:** Development environment configuration should be done as needed, not all upfront
- **Context:** Concern about installing tools that won't be used for weeks
- **Decision:** Implemented "just-in-time installation" approach
- **Changes Made:**
  - Module 1 now only requires: Git, VS Code, Node.js
  - Each subsequent module has **SETUP:** tags indicating when to install tools
  - Added installation timeline (Week 3: PostgreSQL/Redis, Week 4: Hardhat, Week 7: Go, etc.)
  - Created "Installation Philosophy" section explaining the benefits
- **Benefits:** Reduces overwhelm, helps understand tool purpose, saves disk space

**Q4: Learning Documentation**
- **Question:** Document all questions made during the course in a learning_notes file
- **Context:** Need to track learning progress and key decisions
- **Decision:** Created this file (learning_notes.md) to capture questions, insights, and decisions

**Q5: PSD2 Module Placement** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MAJOR REORGANIZATION**
- **Question:** Module 2 (Portuguese Banking & PSD2) is going to be complicated - interacting with Portuguese financial institutions is usually difficult. Move it later in the course.
- **Context:** PSD2 integration involves:
  - Bureaucratic delays for sandbox access
  - Complex OAuth2/certificate flows
  - Potentially poor bank API documentation
  - Heavy regulatory compliance (GDPR, Banco de Portugal)
  - This could be demotivating in week 2 when students are just getting started
- **Decision:** Moved PSD2 from Module 2 ‚Üí Module 9
- **New Course Structure:**
  - **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Blockchain Foundation**
    - Module 1: Environment & Blockchain Basics
    - Module 2: Database Design (moved from old Module 3)
    - Module 3: Smart Contract Foundations (moved from old Module 4)
    - Module 4: Web3 Integration (moved from old Module 5)
  - **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-10): Core Features**
    - Module 5: Allowance System
    - Module 6: API Development & Gateway
    - Module 7: Microservices with Go
    - Module 8: Family Governance & Multi-sig
    - **Module 9: PSD2 Integration** ‚Üê Moved here
    - Module 10: Python Analytics & Banking Features
- **Why This Works Better:**
  - Students first build a working blockchain system (smart contracts, API, governance)
  - PSD2 becomes an "enhancement" to an already functional platform
  - Much more motivating to add banking when you can see the value
  - If PSD2 registration takes weeks, you're not blocked on progress
  - By Week 9, students understand the system well enough to integrate external APIs
- **Updated Milestones:**
  - Milestone 1 (Week 4): Blockchain Foundation Complete
  - Milestone 2 (Week 10): Core Platform + Banking Integration

**Q6: Adding DeFi/DEX Technical Depth** üîß **ENHANCEMENT**
- **Question:** Include technical concepts from first_thought.md (DEX aggregator project) like liquidity pools, bridge transactions, multi-chain deployment, etc.
- **Context:** The original DEX aggregator idea had valuable DeFi concepts that shouldn't be lost in the family-focused pivot:
  - DEX protocols (Uniswap, SushiSwap, Curve)
  - Liquidity pools and AMM mechanics
  - Cross-chain bridges
  - Multi-chain deployment (Polygon, Arbitrum, BSC)
  - MEV protection and slippage safeguards
  - Transaction simulation
  - Blockchain reorganization handling
- **Decision:** Enhanced existing modules to include DeFi concepts where relevant
- **Modules Enhanced:**
  - **Module 1 (Class 1.2):** Added intro to DeFi and DEXs
  - **Module 7 (Class 7.2):** Changed price oracle to fetch from DEXs (Uniswap, SushiSwap), added liquidity pool monitoring
  - **Module 11 (New Class 11.3):** Added "Liquidity Pools & AMM Basics" - Uniswap model, constant product formula (x*y=k), providing liquidity
  - **Module 12 (Complete overhaul):**
    - Class 12.2: Multi-Chain Deployment (Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, gas optimization across chains)
    - Class 12.3: Cross-Chain Bridge Implementation (lock-and-mint pattern)
  - **Module 13:** Added DeFi lending protocol references (Aave, Compound), collateralized vs uncollateralized loans, interest rate models
  - **Module 14 (Major expansion):**
    - Class 14.1: Added MEV protection, front-running prevention, reentrancy guards
    - Class 14.2: New class for DeFi-specific security (slippage protection, oracle manipulation, flash loan attacks, transaction simulation, blockchain reorgs)
- **Updated Sections:**
  - Learning Outcomes: Added AMM mechanics, multi-chain deployment, cross-chain bridges, MEV protection
  - Technology Stack: Added Polygon, Arbitrum, Uniswap V2/V3
  - Milestone 3: Now "Advanced DeFi Features" including liquidity pools, multi-chain, bridges
  - Portfolio Value: Added DeFi expertise as a key differentiator
- **Why This Works:**
  - Adds significant technical depth without losing the relatable family use case
  - Students learn production DeFi patterns (AMMs, bridges) through hands-on building
  - Multi-chain deployment is increasingly important for blockchain developers
  - MEV and slippage protection are critical for real-world DeFi applications
  - Makes the project even more impressive for portfolios (family finance + DeFi expertise)

**Q7: Reading References from Bitcoin Book** üìö **ENHANCEMENT**
- **Question:** Add reading references for each module from the Bitcoin book available in assets/bitcoinbook-develop/
- **Context:** The Bitcoin book provides foundational blockchain concepts that transfer well to Ethereum development
- **Decision:** Added "Reading:" sections to key modules with relevant Bitcoin book chapters
- **Reading References Added:**
  - **Module 1:** Chapter 1 (Introduction), Chapter 2 (How Bitcoin Works), Chapter 3 (Bitcoin Core - Running a Node)
  - **Module 2:** Chapter 6 (Transactions), Chapter 11 (Blockchain - Block Structure)
  - **Module 3:** Chapter 7 (Authorization/Authentication - Scripts), Chapter 9 (Fees)
  - **Module 4:** Chapter 4 (Keys), Chapter 5 (Wallets - HD Wallets, Mnemonic Codes)
  - **Module 8:** Chapter 8 (Signatures - Multi-signature Scripts)
  - **Module 12:** Chapter 10 (Network), Chapter 11 (Blockchain - Merkle Trees, Forks)
  - **Module 14:** Chapter 13 (Security - Best Practices), Chapter 12 (Mining - Consensus Attacks)
- **Why Bitcoin Book for Ethereum Course:**
  - Foundational concepts (keys, wallets, transactions, signatures) are blockchain-agnostic
  - Bitcoin's UTXO model provides contrast to Ethereum's account model (better understanding)
  - Security principles and consensus mechanisms apply across blockchains
  - Multi-sig patterns in Bitcoin translate directly to Ethereum
  - Network architecture and P2P concepts are universal
- **Benefits:**
  - Provides theoretical foundation before hands-on Ethereum implementation
  - Students understand blockchain fundamentals beyond just Ethereum
  - Better prepared for multi-chain development (Module 12)
  - Deeper understanding of why Ethereum made certain design choices

**Q8: Reading References from Ethereum Book** üìö **ENHANCEMENT**
- **Question:** Add reading references for each module from the Ethereum book available in assets/ethereumbook-develop/
- **Context:** The Ethereum book provides direct, practical knowledge for building on Ethereum
- **Decision:** Added Ethereum book references alongside Bitcoin book references in "Reading:" sections
- **Ethereum Book References Added:**
  - **Module 1:** Chapter 1 (What Is Ethereum), Chapter 2 (Intro), Chapter 3 (Clients - Running an Ethereum Client)
  - **Module 2:** Chapter 6 (Transactions - Structure, Data Payload), Chapter 13 (EVM - Ethereum State, Account State)
  - **Module 3:** Chapter 7 (Smart Contracts and Solidity - Introduction, Data Types, Functions), Chapter 9 (Smart Contract Security)

  - **Module 12:** Chapter 11 (Oracles - Oracle Use Cases, Oracle Patterns), Chapter 14 (Consensus - Proof of Work, Proof of Stake)
  - **Module 14:** Chapter 9 (Smart Contract Security - Security Best Practices, Vulnerabilities), Appendix (Development Tools - Testing, Security Analysis Tools)
- **Why Ethereum Book:**
  - Direct applicability to course content (building on Ethereum)
  - Covers Solidity programming in depth
  - Smart contract security specific to Ethereum
  - ERC standards and token development
  - DApp architecture patterns
  - Oracles for real-world data integration (crucial for PSD2/price feeds)
  - Web3.js integration guide
- **Benefits:**
  - Students get both foundational (Bitcoin) and practical (Ethereum) knowledge
  - Two-book approach provides comprehensive understanding
  - Bitcoin book for "why", Ethereum book for "how"
  - Better prepared for production Ethereum development
  - Security coverage from both perspectives (Bitcoin consensus vs Ethereum smart contracts)

## Course Development Insights

### Philosophy Decisions

1. **Just-in-Time Learning:** Install tools only when immediately needed
2. **Use-Case Driven:** Every feature should answer "Would this help my family?"
3. **Portfolio-First:** Build something that demonstrates real-world skills to employers
4. **Multi-Language Exposure:** Use the right tool for each job (Node.js, Go, Python, Solidity)

### Course Structure Rationale

- **20 weeks minimum** (can extend to 40 weeks for part-time)
- **4 clear phases** with milestones to track progress
- **Real deliverables** after each module (not just theory)
- **Portuguese market focus** with PSD2/Open Banking integration

### Professional Course Critique Received

**Q9: Course Critique and Revision** üìä **MAJOR RESTRUCTURING**
- **Question:** Received professional critique of the 20-week course plan - what changes should we make?
- **Context:** Professional course builder reviewed COURSE_PLAN.md and identified several critical issues:
  - Severe pacing problems (20 weeks is unrealistic for the scope)
  - Cognitive overload (too many technologies introduced simultaneously)
  - Missing early wins (first deployable feature came too late)
  - Frontend too late (Week 17 instead of earlier for visual feedback)
  - Go and Python introduced back-to-back causing context-switching fatigue

**Critique Summary:**
- **Overall:** Exceptionally ambitious course with excellent vision but needs restructuring
- **Strengths:** Practical use case, comprehensive coverage, production-ready focus, unique Portuguese banking integration
- **Critical Issues:**
  - 20 weeks attempts to fit 600-800 hours of content into 300-400 hours
  - Too many technologies (4 languages + 30+ tools)
  - Frontend delayed until Week 17 (students need visual feedback earlier)
  - Dense modules need splitting (Module 1, Module 11, Module 12)

**Key Questions from Critique:**
1. **Q1: Would someone with basic JavaScript complete this?**
   - Critique said: No, needs intermediate JavaScript
   - **My Decision:** Fine with me - I have intermediate JavaScript level

2. **Q2: Is this sufficient for blockchain developer role?**
   - Critique said: Yes for junior blockchain developer roles
   - **My Decision:** Acceptable - targeting junior blockchain developer position

3. **Q3: Best course format?**
   - Critique recommended: Hybrid Cohort Model with weekly live sessions
   - **My Decision:** Agree - Claude Code will be my "hybrid cohort"

4. **Q4: Fair pricing?**
   - Critique suggested: $497-$5,997 depending on tier
   - **My Decision:** Not applicable - this is a personal learning project

**My Decisions:**
- ‚úÖ **Extend timeline to 30 weeks** (from 20 weeks) - Accept the realistic pacing
- ‚úÖ **Move frontend to Week 5-6** (from Week 17) - Early visual feedback is critical
- ‚úÖ **Keep both Go AND Python** - Want to learn both, but sequence them better with breathing room
- ‚ùå **Reject Alternative Course Structures** - Want this as ONE complete course, not split
- ‚úÖ **Add buffer weeks** - Week 8, 14, 21, 28 for consolidation
- ‚úÖ **Mark advanced DeFi as optional** - Liquidity pools, cross-chain bridges
- ‚úÖ **Split dense modules** - Module 1 into 3 weeks, better pacing overall

**Changes Made to COURSE_PLAN.md:**

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Module 1 split into 3 weeks:**
   - Week 1: Environment + Theory only (no node installation yet)
   - Week 2: Just Geth (removed Bitcoind to reduce complexity)
   - Week 3: CLI interactions + Hardhat setup

2. **Frontend moved to Week 6:**
   - Early visual feedback for students
   - Can test smart contracts with UI much earlier
   - Better engagement and motivation
   - "Early Win" in Week 6: See wallet balance in UI you built

3. **Go and Python separated:**
   - Go: Weeks 11-12 (with buffer week 14 after)
   - Python: Weeks 17-18 (after PSD2 integration)
   - No back-to-back language introduction

4. **Buffer weeks added (4 total):**
   - Week 8: After blockchain foundation
   - Week 14: After Go introduction and before Python
   - Week 21: After Python and governance features
   - Week 28: Before final production push

5. **Advanced topics marked as optional:**
   - Liquidity Pools & AMM (was Module 11 Class 3)
   - Cross-chain Bridges (was Module 12 Class 3)
   - Advanced GraphQL/WebSockets
   - These can be done after Week 30 or in parallel

6. **Early wins added throughout:**

   - Milestone 2: Week 16 (was Week 10)
   - Milestone 3: Week 24 (was Week 16)
   - Milestone 4: Week 30 (was Week 20)

8. **Timeline tracks updated:**
   - Standard Track: 30 weeks at 15-20 hours/week (was 20 weeks)
   - Intensive Track: 30 weeks at 30-40 hours/week (was 20 weeks)
   - Extended Track: 40 weeks at 10-15 hours/week (was 40 weeks)

9. **Prerequisites updated:**
   - Changed "Basic JavaScript" to "Intermediate JavaScript/TypeScript proficiency"
   - Added specific requirements: async/await, promises, OOP concepts
   - Added Node.js ecosystem familiarity

10. **Learning outcomes reorganized:**
    - Separated core skills from optional advanced skills
    - Made clear what's achievable in 30 weeks
    - Advanced DeFi (AMMs, bridges) moved to "Optional" section

**Why This Structure Works Better:**
- **Realistic pacing:** 30 weeks allows proper depth without rushing
- **Early engagement:** Frontend in Week 6 provides visual progress
- **Better language sequencing:** Go and Python separated by 5 weeks
- **Recovery time:** 4 buffer weeks prevent burnout
- **Clear core vs advanced:** Students know what's essential vs optional
- **Proven approach:** Addresses all major critique points while keeping project vision

**Rationale for Keeping Both Go and Python:**
While the critique suggested removing one language, I decided to keep both because:
1. Go is essential for high-performance blockchain event listeners and price oracles
2. Python is ideal for data analytics and banking features (round-ups, ML patterns)
3. The new sequencing (Weeks 11-12 for Go, Weeks 17-18 for Python) provides breathing room
4. This matches real-world blockchain development (polyglot skillset)
5. Each language serves a distinct purpose in the architecture

**Validation:**
- Course now has realistic 450-600 hour timeline (30 weeks √ó 15-20 hrs)
- Matches critique's recommendation of 30 weeks minimum
- Addresses all "Red Flags" identified (burnout risk, setup frustration, scope creep)
- Maintains unique differentiators (Portuguese banking, family use case)
- Keeps comprehensive technical depth while being achievable

## Session: 2025-10-21

### Week 1 Progress - Environment Setup and First Smart Contract

**Q10: Starting Week 1 of FamilyChain Course** üöÄ **COURSE START**
- **Context:** Beginning the 30-week FamilyChain blockchain development course
- **Learning Style Documented:** Added teaching approach to CLAUDE.md
  - Hands-on learner (developer background)
  - Self-directed execution (user runs commands, Claude guides)
  - Interactive dialogue (questions welcomed)
  - Using PowerShell on Windows
  - Using VS Code with extensions
  - Active recall for basic commands (sparingly)

**Classes Completed:**

‚úÖ **Class 1.1: Environment Setup**
- Git 2.38.1 ‚úÖ
- Node.js v22.14.0 ‚úÖ
- npm 11.6.2 ‚úÖ
- VS Code extensions configured (Solidity, Hardhat Solidity, Prettier, ESLint)
- Created `.vscode/extensions.json` for project recommendations

‚úÖ **Class 1.2: Blockchain Architecture Theory**
- Learned blockchain fundamentals (blocks, chains, consensus)
- Bitcoin vs Ethereum differences
- Gas mechanism and purpose
- Wallets and cryptographic keys
- Smart contracts vs traditional applications
- DeFi basics (Uniswap, staking, multi-sig, DAOs)
- Testnets vs mainnet
- **User demonstrated strong comprehension** - explained gas, immutability, and Bitcoin vs Ethereum correctly

‚úÖ **Class 1.3: Plan First Smart Contract**
- Created `blockchain/` folder structure
- Initialized npm project
- **Wrote HelloFamily.sol contract independently!**
  - State variables: `greeting`, `owner`
  - Constructor with initial greeting
  - Access control using `require()`
  - `view` function for reading greeting
  - Event emission for `GreetingChanged`
  - Code quality: Production-ready for first contract!

**HelloFamily.sol Code (Written by User):**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

contract HelloFamily {
  string public greeting;
  address public owner;

  event GreetingChanged(string newGreeting, address changedBy);

  constructor(string memory _greeting) {
    greeting = _greeting;
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can set the greeting");
    greeting = _greeting;
    emit GreetingChanged(_greeting, msg.sender);
  }

  function greet() public view returns (string memory) {
    return greeting;
  }
}
```

**Technical Issue Encountered:**
- **Problem:** Hardhat 3 Beta has compatibility issues with Node.js 22 on Windows
  - Error: `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED` when running `npx hardhat compile`
  - Native module (`edr.win32-x64-msvc.node`) failed to load
- **Decision:** Switch to Hardhat 2.22.0 (stable, production-ready)
- **Rationale:**
  - Hardhat 3 is beta (rough edges expected)
  - Learning fundamentals (Hardhat 2 vs 3 differences don't matter)
  - All tutorials/documentation use Hardhat 2
  - Can upgrade to Hardhat 3 later when stable

**Current Status:**
- About to delete `blockchain/` folder and restart with Hardhat 2
- HelloFamily.sol code saved above (will recreate after Hardhat 2 setup)
- Need to close VS Code to release file locks on `node_modules`

**Next Steps (When Resuming):**
1. Delete `blockchain/` folder via File Explorer (VS Code closed)
2. Recreate `blockchain/` folder
3. Initialize npm project
4. Install Hardhat 2.22.0
5. Run `npx hardhat init` (choose TypeScript + Mocha + Ethers.js)
6. Recreate `HelloFamily.sol` contract
7. Compile with `npx hardhat compile`
8. Write tests for HelloFamily
9. Deploy to Sepolia testnet (Week 1 Early Win!)

**Key Learnings:**
- User learns best by doing and asking questions
- Successfully wrote first smart contract independently
- Understood Solidity concepts (state, functions, events, access control)
- Encountered real-world development issue (version compatibility)
- Made pragmatic decision (stable vs bleeding-edge)

## Session: 2025-10-22

### Week 1 Completion - Hardhat 3 Success & First Deployment

**Q11: Completing Week 1 with Hardhat 3** üöÄ **WEEK 1 COMPLETE**

**Context:** Resumed Week 1 after previous Hardhat 3 compatibility issues

**Decision: Successfully switched to Hardhat 3**
- **Previous Issue:** Hardhat 3 Beta had native module loading errors on Windows with Node.js 22
- **Resolution:** Issue resolved - Hardhat 3 now works perfectly
- **Key Learning:** Hardhat 3 uses `npx hardhat build` (not `compile`)
- **Root Cause Identified:** User discovered the command difference in documentation

**Hardhat 3 Setup Completed:**
- Installed Hardhat 3 via `npx hardhat --init`
- Chose TypeScript + Mocha testing setup
- Example contracts (Counter.sol) compiled and tested successfully
- Both Solidity tests and Mocha tests working

**HelloFamily.sol Contract (Recreated from memory):**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

contract HelloFamily {
    string public greeting;
    address public owner;

    event GreetingChanged(string newGreeting, address changedBy);

    constructor(string memory _greeting) {
        greeting = _greeting;
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can set greeting");
        greeting = _greeting;
        emit GreetingChanged(_greeting, msg.sender);
    }
}
```

**Key Improvements Made:**
- Removed redundant getter functions (public variables auto-generate getters)
- Added `address changedBy` to GreetingChanged event for better tracking

**Testing Framework - TypeScript Required:**
- **Discovery:** Tests must be written in TypeScript (.ts), not JavaScript (.js)
- Created `test/HelloFamily.ts` with comprehensive test suite
- All 5 tests passing:
  1. ‚úÖ Should return the correct greeting message
  2. ‚úÖ Owner is set correctly
  3. ‚úÖ Owner can change the greeting
  4. ‚úÖ Non-owner CANNOT change the greeting
  5. ‚úÖ Event is emitted when greeting changes

**Key Testing Concepts Learned:**
- **ethers.getContractFactory()**: Factory pattern for contract deployment
- **HelloFamily.deploy()**: Creates new contract instance on blockchain
- **Hardhat's test blockchain**: Temporary in-memory blockchain for tests
- **await pattern**: All blockchain operations are async (view and transactions)
- **ethers.getSigners()**: Hardhat provides ~20 pre-made test accounts
- **Default signer**: Hardhat uses first signer (account 0) for deployment by default
- **.connect(account)**: Specifies which account calls a function
- **View functions vs Transactions**: Reading is free/fast, writing costs gas/takes time
- **Testing access control**: Using multiple signers to test authorization

**User Understanding Highlights:**
- Connected factory pattern to previous knowledge
- Understood ethers as "bridge between JavaScript and blockchain"
- Grasped async/await necessity for blockchain interactions
- Questioned redundant getters (public variables) - excellent attention to detail
- Debugged test file extension issue independently (.js ‚Üí .ts)
- Asked security-critical questions about wallet safety

**Deployment to Sepolia Testnet:**

**Deployment Script Created:**
- `scripts/deploy.ts` with deployment logic
- Prints deployed contract address for Etherscan verification

**Wallet Security Setup:**
- Generated new testnet-only wallet via ethers.Wallet.createRandom()
- **Security awareness:** User asked about wallet safety before proceeding
- Explained private key security (never share, can't be changed)
- Created `.env.example` for documentation (professional best practice - user's idea!)
- Added `.env` to `.gitignore` (user proactively secured secrets)

**Hardhat 3 Configuration Variables:**
- **Discovery:** Hardhat 3 uses `configVariable()` instead of dotenv
- **User found solution:** Read Hardhat docs, discovered `keystore` command
- Used `npx hardhat keystore set --dev SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY`
- Used `npx hardhat keystore set --dev --force SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`
- **More secure than .env:** Encrypted storage on local machine
- Deleted `.env` file (not needed with keystore)
- Updated `.env.example` to document keystore approach

**Getting Testnet ETH:**
- Tried Alchemy faucet (requires 0.001 mainnet ETH - blocked)
- Tried Infura faucet (requires MetaMask - deferred for Week 6)
- **Success:** Used Google Cloud POW faucet (proof-of-work)
- Verified receipt on Etherscan transaction explorer
- Checked balance via ethers JSON-RPC provider

**RPC Provider Issues:**
- `rpc.sepolia.org` returned 522 error (server down)
- Switched to `https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com` (working)

**Deployment Success! üéâ**
- **Contract Address:** `0x21581Db891aAb5cB99d6002Aaa83C6c480960267`
- **Network:** Sepolia Testnet
- **Deployment Command:** `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia`
- **Result:** Live smart contract on public blockchain!
- **Etherscan:** https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x21581Db891aAb5cB99d6002Aaa83C6c480960267

**Contract Verification:**
- Attempted to interact with contract on Etherscan
- **Discovery:** "Read Contract" tab requires verification
- Verification uploads source code to Etherscan for readable interface
- **Decision:** Deferred contract verification to future session

**Week 1 Achievements:**
‚úÖ Development environment setup (Git, Node.js, VS Code, Hardhat 3)
‚úÖ Blockchain theory fundamentals understood
‚úÖ Hardhat 3 project initialized with TypeScript
‚úÖ HelloFamily.sol smart contract written from memory
‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite (5 tests, all passing)
‚úÖ Secure wallet management (keystore approach)
‚úÖ Testnet ETH acquired via POW faucet
‚úÖ Deployed to Sepolia testnet successfully
‚úÖ **Week 1 Early Win Achieved!** üöÄ

**Technical Skills Demonstrated:**
- Independent problem-solving (found keystore command in docs)
- Security-conscious development (wallet safety, .gitignore, .env.example)
- Debugging (test file extension, RPC provider issues)
- Reading documentation (Hardhat 3 docs, faucet research)
- Professional best practices (.env.example, source control)
- Active learning (questioning, explaining concepts back)

**Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **Hardhat 3 over Hardhat 2:** Bleeding-edge but now stable
2. **TypeScript for tests:** Required by Hardhat 3 setup
3. **Keystore over .env:** More secure, Hardhat 3 recommended approach
4. **Public RPC provider:** Good for learning, will use Infura/Alchemy later
5. **POW faucet:** Most reliable free option for testnet ETH

**Next Steps (Before Week 2):**
- üìñ **COMPLETE WEEK 1 READING** (User will do this before next session):
  - Bitcoin Book: Chapter 1 (Introduction), Chapter 2 (How Bitcoin Works - Bitcoin Overview)
  - Ethereum Book: Chapter 1 (What Is Ethereum), Chapter 2 (Intro)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **REMINDER FOR NEXT SESSION: Ask if reading was completed!**

**Next Steps (Week 2):**
- Install and run Geth (Ethereum client)
- Sync to Sepolia testnet
- Understand node operations and monitoring
- Get more testnet ETH from faucets
- Learn about RPC endpoints and JSON-RPC

**Questions to Explore Later:**
- [ ] How to verify contracts on Etherscan (programmatically)
- [ ] Should we use Infura/Alchemy for production RPC (instead of public nodes)?
- [ ] When to introduce MetaMask (currently planned for Week 6)

**Documentation Updates (Post-Session):**
- **Issue Identified:** Documentation was referencing outdated Hardhat 2.x commands and patterns
- **User Feedback:** "Make sure to always look up the documentation whose version is more similar to the one we are using"
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with exact tool versions (Node.js v22.14.0, Hardhat 3.0.8, ethers.js 6.15.0, etc.)
  - Added "Current Project Versions" section with documentation links
  - Fixed all Hardhat commands (`build` not `compile`, `keystore` not `.env`)
  - Updated COURSE_PLAN.md with version requirements and breaking changes
  - Added comprehensive "Tool Versions & Documentation" table
  - Highlighted Hardhat 3 breaking changes with ‚ö†Ô∏è warnings
- **Result:** Documentation now accurately reflects Hardhat 3.0.8 + ethers.js v6 + TypeScript workflow
